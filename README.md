# AI-Powered Health Assistant

## Overview

The AI-Powered Health Assistant is an interactive application that leverages machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide health-related insights and recommendations. This project is built using **Streamlit**, **Transformers**, **TensorFlow**, **NLTK**, and **TF-Keras**.

## Features

- **Symptom Analysis**: Users can input symptoms, and the AI will suggest possible conditions.
- **Health Recommendations**: Provides lifestyle and general health advice based on user input.
- **Chatbot Assistance**: A chatbot interface to answer health-related queries using NLP.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and interactive experience.

## Technologies Used

- [**Streamlit**](https://streamlit.io/) - For creating the web-based interactive UI.
- [**Transformers**](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) - For leveraging pre-trained NLP models.
- [**TensorFlow**](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - For machine learning model training and inference.
- [**NLTK**](https://www.nltk.org/) - For natural language processing tasks.
- [**TF-Keras**](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras) - For deep learning model development.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (>=3.7). Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install streamlit transformers tensorflow nltk tf-keras
```

## Running the Application

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-health-assistant.git
   cd ai-health-assistant
   ```
2. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. Open the provided URL in your browser to access the application.

## Usage

- Enter symptoms in the input field to receive possible diagnoses.
- Ask health-related questions to the chatbot.
- Get health tips and lifestyle recommendations.

## Future Enhancements

- **Integration with Wearable Devices**: Fetch real-time health data.
- **Voice Support**: Enable voice interaction for accessibility.
- **Expanded Knowledge Base**: Enhance chatbot responses with medical literature.
